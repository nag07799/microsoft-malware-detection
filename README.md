Microsoft Malware Detection Case Study
This case study focuses on the detection of malware, which refers to malicious software designed to harm data, devices, or individuals. Microsoft, being actively involved in building anti-malware products, generates a vast amount of data from millions of computers worldwide. The goal of this project is to analyze and classify malware into different families using machine learning techniques.

Problem Statement
The challenge is to accurately identify whether a given file or software is malware. The objective is to minimize multi-class error and provide probability estimates for multiple classes. Additionally, the malware detection process should be efficient, taking only seconds or a few minutes to complete.

Dataset Overview
The dataset provided by Microsoft contains approximately 9 classes of malware. It consists of both .asm files (assembly language files) and .bytes files (hexadecimal representation of binary content without the PE header). The total training dataset size is 200GB, with 50GB for .bytes files and 150GB for .asm files. The dataset comprises a total of 21,736 files, including 10,868 each of .bytes and .asm files.

Real-world/Business Objectives and Constraints
Minimize multi-class error in malware classification.
Provide multi-class probability estimates.
Ensure efficient malware detection within seconds or minutes.
Data Overview
The dataset consists of two types of files for each malware: .asm files and .bytes files. The raw data in .bytes files contains the hexadecimal representation of the binary content without the PE header. The total number of malware classes is 9, including Ramnit, Lollipop, Kelihos_ver3, Vundo, Simda, Tracur, Kelihos_ver1, Obfuscator.ACY, and Gatak.
